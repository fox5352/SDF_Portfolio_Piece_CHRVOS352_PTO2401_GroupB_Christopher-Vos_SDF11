# Presentation Talking Points

# Slide 1: Introduction
**Talking Points:**

- Hi, im christopher and this project is a example banking page

- this project includes tailwind for easy development and good old Html and Javascript

- so in this project we have the html page a assets folder and a tailwind config file

# Slide 2: Component 1 - Project Setup and Responsive Navigation
**Talking Points:**

- this page is built for mobile users first and it uses media queries to adjust for bigger screens. and in doing so i found it saves a lot of time

- My implementation of the responsive navigation bar is mainly focused on mobile, when in smaller screen views the nav bar becomes fixed to the top for a easier time

- The base layout uses semantic HTML header nav's sections and footer

# Slide 3: Component 2 - Hero and Endorsements
**Talking Points:**

- so this call to action was fun to make because the way it is made on smaller screens it actually uses flex-col-reverse its the first time i used this and

- Detail the creation of the hero section using Tailwind CSS for styling and grid layout for alignment.

# Slide 4: Component 3 - Features
**Talking Points:**

- I used grid to make a dynamic layout that adjusts to the screen size

- I used aria description to signify that this are just info blocks and not buttons or links

# Slide 5: Component 4 - Stats and Getting Started Section
**Talking Points:**

- On the getting started section i used contrast and split colors to grab the user's attention

- this layout used flex and flex-direction to make the 'Getting Started' section

<!-- - Highlight the use of JavaScript for animating statistics counters upon scrolling into view. -->
- I did not use any animation as it wasn't communicated to me to do so  

# Slide 6: Component 5 - Contact and Footer
**Talking Points:**

- since the links uses icons i used aria-label to indicate where the links goes to

<!-- - Detail the implementation of the contact form using HTML5 form elements and JavaScript for form validation.
- I have no idea what forms this is talking about because it is'nt shown -->

- I used a flex layout and center the items inside it.
